## Disclaimer
**I am NOT responsible for anything that happens to your computer.**

Windows Debloat only supports Windows 10.

## Usage
Simply download the binary executable from the releases page and run it.

If you wish to build Windows Debloat from source, the only non-native package you'll need is PyQt5.

``pip install PyQt5``

## Why this exists
This project exists because I often reformat my computer and became tired of reconfiguring Windows 10.
