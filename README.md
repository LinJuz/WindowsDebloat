Reduce Windows telemetry, cut down on visual and 'technical' annoyances, and remove unneeded apps & features.

## Run through terminal

If you have a terminal you prefer, you may use it to display output information.

Just call the .exe in your **elevated** terminal like any other executible binary: ``WindowsDebloat.exe``

## Installation & Usage
Simply download the binary executable from the releases page and run it.

If you wish to build Windows Debloat using a Python compiler, the only non-native package you'll need is PyQt5.

``pip install PyQt5``

The same applies if you just want to edit or run Windows Debloat using Python.

## Why does this exist
This project exists because I often reformat my computer and became tired of reconfiguring Windows 10. 


## Disclaimer
**I am NOT responsible for anything that happens to your computer.**

Windows Debloat only supports Windows 10.
